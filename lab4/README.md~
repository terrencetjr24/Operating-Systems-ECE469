# How to build solution
 - to run question 1 (one-level implementation), run the following commands: 
```
$ cd lab4/one-level/os
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd ../apps/example
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run

 - to run the question 3 (fork implementation), directly after running Q1:
$ cd ../../..

$ cd fork/os
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd ../apps/single_fork_call
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run

 - to run question 5 (heap implementation), directly after running Q3:
$ cd ../../..

$ 
```

# Peculiarities about our Solution
 - When running the example code inside of prio_test, our processes display their print statements in the proper order except for two statements.
 - The two statements are A22 and C5 that are swapped
 - The reason that the two statements are swapped is likely becasue the C process spends too much time in the same queue as the A process (allowing it to finish C5 before A22), which was likely casued by a rounding difference from our estcpu calculations
