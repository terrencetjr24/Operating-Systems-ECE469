# How to build solution
 - to run question 1 (one-level implementation), run the following commands: 
```
$ cd lab4/one-level/os
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd ../apps/example
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run
```

 - to run the question 3 (fork implementation), directly after running Q1:
```
$ cd ../../..

$ cd fork/os
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd ../apps/single_fork_call
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run
```

 - to run question 5 (heap implementation), directly after running Q3:
```
$ cd ../../..

$ cd heap-mgmt/os
$ make clean
$ make
$ cd ../apps/given_example
$ make clean
$ make
$ make run
